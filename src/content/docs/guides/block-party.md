Hosting a block party is a great way to build community and get to know your neighbors. Not just by having the party but by trying to include others in an event that benefits everyone on your block. We hope that you will find this guide as a good jumping off point to start you on your block party journey.



##   1. Planning Your Block Party
  
> * **Block Party Permit:**
    * **Cost:** Free
    * **Where to Apply:** [Portland Bureau of Transportation - Apply for a Block Party Permit](https://www.portland.gov/transportation/permitting/portland-streets/apply-block-party-permit)
>    * **Application Timeline:** Submit at least 15 days prior to the event (allow extra time).
>    * **Eligible Streets:** Permits are for residential streets only. Major roads are ineligible (check the PBOT site for exclusions).
  
> * **Street Closure Time:** Must be between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., not to exceed 8 hours per week.  


###   1.1. Initial Planning

The first step is to plan the fundamentals of your block party. Consider these points:

* **What do you want to achieve?** Do you want a simple social gathering, or do you have other goals?
* **What is your neighborhood like?** Consider the demographics, languages spoken, and how well neighbors know each other.
* **Date and Time:** Choose a date and time that works for most of your neighbors.
    * Check with neighbors to avoid conflicts.
    * Consider the duration of the party (3 hours is a good starting point)
    * Factor in setup and cleanup time, aiming to finish at least one hour before sunset.
* **Bad Weather Plans:** Have a backup plan in case of rain or extreme weather.
* **Area Covered:** Decide which area to include. Inviting multiple blocks can increase participation.
    * Consider natural neighborhood boundaries.
    * Aim to invite at least 70 households.
* **Street to Block Off:** Determine the street and the specific section you want to close.
    * The street closure permit must be for your street.
    * The center of activity is often at the host's house.

###   1.2. Forming a Team

While one person *can* organize a block party, it's easier and more fun with a team.

* Recruit 2-5 neighbors to help with invitations and organization.
* Divide tasks among team members, ensuring everyone understands the goal of bringing the neighborhood together.

##   2. Obtaining a Street Closure Permit

To legally close a street in Portland, you need a Block Party Permit from the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT).

* Apply for the permit at least 15 days before your event (PBOT recommends 7 business days, but allow extra time).
* The permit must be requested by a resident of the street being closed.
* You can find the application and detailed instructions on the PBOT website: [https://www.portland.gov/transportation/permitting/portland-streets/apply-block-party-permit](https://www.portland.gov/transportation/permitting/portland-streets/apply-block-party-permit)

* **Important Notes:**
    * You cannot close major roads (check the PBOT website for a list).
    -- Must be on a street classified as "Local Service Traffic" [Check here](https://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=d1d5e545ca6f436fb119932d710ff2fb)
    * Specify the exact street closure times in your application (e.g., one hour before the party starts to one hour after it ends).
    * Mention the street closure in your invitation flyer.
* PBOT provides a standard invitation flyer, but you can create your own.
* Barricades and signage may be available through your neighborhood association or the city; check when you apply for your permit.
* Must be free and open to the general public.
* Take place between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., not to exceed 8 hours per week. 
* Block Parties may span up to 2 blocks (or up to 4 for street paintings), but intersections must remain open. It will take us longer to review applications to close multiple blocks.  

##   3. Planning Food and Drinks

* Potlucks are a simple and popular option.
    * As the host, consider providing water and a main dish.
    * Encourage people to label food for dietary restrictions (meat, gluten, nuts, etc.).
    * Use washable plates, cutlery, and glasses to minimize waste.
* Consider setting a budget for food and drinks.

##   4. Choosing Music and Activities

* Music can enhance the atmosphere.
    * Use a portable sound system and create a playlist with diverse music.
    * Consider an open mic for local musicians or even karaoke (in moderation!).
* Plan activities for both adults and children.
    * Games, crafts, and a designated bike area are great options.
    * If you have a bouncy castle, prioritize safety with dedicated adult supervision.
    * Check if the fire department can make an appearance with a fire truck!

##   5. Inviting Your Neighbors

Inviting neighbors is crucial for a successful block party.

* Invite everyone in the designated area, even those you don't know well.
* Invite multiple times using different methods:
    * Door-to-door invitations (a week or two before and a reminder a day or two before)
    * Flyers posted around the neighborhood
    * Word-of-mouth
    * Phone or email (if you have contact information)
* When going door-to-door, be friendly and informative.
* Leave flyers if no one is home.
* Contact property managers for reaching residents in apartments or condos.
* Remove flyers after the event.

##   6. During the Party

* Your main role is to mingle and make everyone feel welcome.
* Introduce yourself to people you don't know.
* The easiest approach for bathrooms is for people to use their own.
* Welcome everyone and introduce any speakers or activities.

##   7. After the Party

* Ask for volunteers to help with cleanup.
* Leave the area clean.
* Share contact information (if people consented).
* Thank your team!
