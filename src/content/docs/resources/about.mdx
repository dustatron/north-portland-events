## Our Mission
North Portland Events is a community-driven resource dedicated to connecting neighbors with neighbors across North Portland. We believe that strong communities are built through meaningful interactions, shared experiences, and local engagement. Our mission is to highlight the vibrant community events, activities, and resources that make North Portland special, with a particular focus on family-friendly gatherings, free events, and community-building initiatives like block parties.

## Who We Are
North Portland Events is maintained by Dusty, a volunteer with the Arbor Lodge Neighborhood Association. We currently manage the North Portland neighborhood events Google calendar and have expanded to this website in 2025 to create a more comprehensive community resource.

## What We Offer
This website serves as a community wiki and event calendar specifically for North Portland residents. Here you'll find:

A curated calendar of local events
Information about neighborhood associations
Community resources
Opportunities for civic engagement
Spotlights on local non-profits and their initiatives
Community Participation
We believe in the power of community contribution. While we're just getting started, we're working to implement systems that allow neighbors to submit events via email or request posting access directly to the site. This feature will be coming soon!

In the meantime, we encourage you to explore the events we've gathered and reach out if you know of something happening in our community that should be featured.

## Our Vision
We envision North Portland Events becoming the go-to resource for community connection in our areaâ€”a digital town square where neighbors can discover ways to engage with each other, support local initiatives, and strengthen our community bonds.

Unlike traditional event calendars, we're building a collaborative wiki-style platform that grows through community input and focuses exclusively on the unique character and needs of North Portland neighborhoods.

Join us in making North Portland an even more connected, engaged, and vibrant place to live!
